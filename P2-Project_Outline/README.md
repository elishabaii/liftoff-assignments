## Submission Instructions

### Overview


We here at QuaraTeam find that when traveling we desire to see the lesser-known parts of the world.  If we're in New York we want to see the now-renovated fancy bar that once housed a legendary nightclub - not the Statue of Liberty!  We want to find that great hiking trail near our motel in Peoria, not the fastest route to Navy Pier.  Hidden Gems brings those experiences to your fingertips.

Hidden Gems searches near your location for user-submitted sights and experiences that fit your needs.  With filtering based on activity type, age/family friendliness, accessibility, and cost filters you can be sure you will find the best and most relevant travel activities every time you log in to our app.  You can also befriend other users on the platform to stay on top of their latest and greatest adventures.
